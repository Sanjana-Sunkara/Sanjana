# 🏀 ASCII Basketball Simulation 🏀

#### 🎥 Video Demo:  <INSERT_YOUR_VIDEO_URL_HERE>

#### 📋 Description:

**ASCII Basketball Simulation** is a fun, interactive terminal-based basketball game built in Python! Using just your keyboard, you’ll line up shots by entering an **angle (1–90°)** and **power (1–30)** — then watch your shot fly across an ASCII basketball court thanks to real projectile motion physics.

Each shot is unique; the hoop 🏀 moves to a new random location after every attempt, so you’ll need to adjust your aim and power every time. You’ve got **10 seconds per input** and **5 total shots**, so take your best shot and beat the buzzer! ⏱️

Score **3 or more baskets**, and you’ll hear a celebratory sound and see a trophy message.

### ✨ Features:
-  Animated ball movement using physics (sine, cosine, gravity)
-  Randomized hoop positions after every shot
-  Timed inputs to keep the pace exciting
-  Live score and shot tracking on screen
-  Fully ASCII-rendered basketball court, hoop, and ball

This game is coded using only **Python standard libraries**, with **no external packages** — just logic, math, and some ASCII art magic! It was created as my final project for **Harvard CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python**, and blends my love for coding and basketball. 🧠+🏀

### 🛠️ Concepts Demonstrated:
- Input validation and timed input
- Projectile motion with physics formulas
- Console animation with ASCII graphics
- Use of `SystemRandom`, `time`, and `os` for randomness and UI
- Structured code using reusable functions
